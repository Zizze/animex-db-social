This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Anime Database

This project is a database of anime that was created for practice and as an interesting project for me to develop for almost three and a half months.
During this project, I became familiar with rtk query, Next.js, Firebase, and other libraries. The following technologies were used: Next.js, Redux Toolkit (rtk query), Firebase (back-end), SCSS modules, and TypeScript. The project includes features such as registration, adding friends, a general chat, personal watched lists, personal rating, comments, messages, profile, admin panel, mass mailing, support, block - unblock users, admins action, personal settings, and many other features.

As you can see, there are no commits for the first 2-3 months, all because of the operating system failure, and since the project was locally stored, the commits were lost and couldn't be restored.

If you have any personal questions, you can reach me at vjvjpchela@gmail.com.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
